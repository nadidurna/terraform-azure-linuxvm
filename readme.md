<h1> Terraform With Azure </h1>

<p> 
 This repo created for a simple project which deploys a linux virtual machine to Microsoft Azure.
</p>

<p>
Main purpose of this project is provision a basically configured linux virtual machine which you can use for some development or test cases. Also there is a Docker installation inside of the installed linux virtual machine.
</p>

<p>
Using some VS Code extension you can connect with ssh to your brand new virtual machine and also you can test your Docker installation. The extensions used for this project listed below: 

1. Terraform (by Anton Kulikov)
2. Remote - SSH (by Microsoft)
</p>
<p>
NOTE: For the authentication Azure CLI was used. You need to install Azure CLI locally (if it is not installed before) and login to your account which will be used for this project.
</p>

<p>
There are two files which include ssh scripts for connection with VS Code interface. Using the Remote - SSH extension you can easily connect the created virtual machine.

The public ip of the virtual machine will be shown on the terminal after the installation.
